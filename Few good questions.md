- any solid proof to sha 256 er reverse direction doent exist
	ie no hard proof exist that the fuction sha 256 inverse is infeasible 
- what is it that proof of work e u proof ??
  you prove that you did the work(computation of increasingly cryptographic hash functions) and you need to do the computations to carry out the exact value and stuff
- look into how differnet blockchains solve the byantine fault tollerance
