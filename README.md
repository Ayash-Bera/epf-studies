A list of all the resources you will need to venture your journey to EPF

## Starting with Ethereum Yellow Paper
Ethereum Yellow paper is a great place to start your ethereum journey. And here are some resources that we followed

## Next we go over the Ethereum Execution Client
The Ethereum Exeuction Client is the next big thing that we read. And here are the resources by step that is needed.
