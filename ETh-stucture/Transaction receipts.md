# Ethereum Transaction Receipts

A transaction receipt in Ethereum is a data structure that provides information about the execution of a transaction. It's generated after a transaction has been included in a block and the block has been mined.

## Key Components of a Transaction Receipt:

1. **Transaction Hash**: 
   - A 32-byte hash of the transaction

2. **Transaction Index**: 
   - Integer of the transaction's index position in the block

3. **Block Hash**: 
   - 32-byte hash of the block where this transaction was in

4. **Block Number**: 
   - Block number where this transaction was in

5. **From**: 
   - 20-byte address of the sender

6. **To**: 
   - 20-byte address of the recipient. `null` if it was a contract creation transaction

7. **Cumulative Gas Used**: 
   - The total amount of gas used when this transaction was executed in the block

8. **Gas Used**: 
   - The amount of gas used by this specific transaction alone

9. **Contract Address**: 
   - The address of the contract created, if the transaction was a contract creation. `null` otherwise

10. **Logs**: 
    - Array of log objects, which this transaction generated

11. **Logs Bloom Filter**: 
    - 256-byte bloom filter for light clients to quickly retrieve related logs

12. **Status**: 
    - Either 1 (success) or 0 (failure)

## Importance of Transaction Receipts:

1. **Confirmation**: Provides proof that a transaction was included in a block
2. **Gas Usage**: Allows precise calculation of gas costs
3. **Event Tracking**: Through logs, enables efficient tracking of on-chain events
4. **State Changes**: Indicates whether the transaction successfully changed the state
5. **Smart Contract Interaction**: Essential for understanding the results of contract function calls

## Example (simplified JSON representation):

```json
{
  "transactionHash": "0x...",
  "transactionIndex": 3,
  "blockHash": "0x...",
  "blockNumber": 8982282,
  "from": "0x...",
  "to": "0x...",
  "cumulativeGasUsed": 6721975,
  "gasUsed": 21000,
  "contractAddress": null,
  "logs": [],
  "logsBloom": "0x...",
  "status": 1
}
```

Transaction receipts are crucial for developers and users to understand the outcomes of their transactions and for applications to track and respond to on-chain events efficiently.
