While Ethereum has its own native cryptocurrency (Ether) that follows almost exactly the same intuitive rules, it also enables a much more powerful function: [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/). For this more complex feature, a more sophisticated analogy is required. Instead of a distributed ledger, Ethereum is a distributed [state machine(opens in a new tab)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine). Ethereum's state is a large data structure which holds not only all accounts and balances, but a _machine state_, which can change from block to block according to a pre-defined set of rules, and which can execute arbitrary machine code. The specific rules of changing state from block to block are defined by the EVM.
